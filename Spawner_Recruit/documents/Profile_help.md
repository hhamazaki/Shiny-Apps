# Management Target 

## Profile Analyses
Profile Analyses have two profiles: MSY and Rmax profiles that provide basis for Smsy and Smax based escapement goal range. Both profiles are probabilities of producing a **long term mean** yield/recruit greater than q% of MSY/Rmax at given spawner size.  The profile based escapement goal range is determined by setting a target minimum probability (p) of achieving the goal (i.e. intersection of the profile at given p). Standard profiles are q = 90, 80, and 70% and p = 90%.  

**Note** Calculation of probability is based on Bayesian posterior MCMC simulation sample. Value of MSY/Rmax differ in each sample. In other words, MSY could 10000 in one sample and 5000 in another sample. 
If management object is attaining **defined** yield or recruitment, please use yield and recruitment analyses.  

### MSY Profile 
MSY Profile calculates the probability of a given escapement producing an yields that are above q% of MSY.  The MSY profile is calculated in following steps.  
* In each Bayesian sample of SR parameters (j) and given spawner range(S)
  * Calculate expected yield $Y_{j}(S_{i})$ and find the maximum yield (**MSY**) $Max(Y_{j})$
  * Assign $X_{i,j}$ to 1 if the expected yield is above the minimum q% of the MSY or 0 if otherwise
* At each escapement take the mean of X from all the simulation samples. 
* MSY Profile Range $S_{MSY}$ is a range of spawners such that the profile probability is above the minimum p% target. 

This is written as: 
**MSY based spawner profile**
$$P(S_{i}) =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{i,j}}{n}$$
where
$$X_{i,j}=\\begin{cases}
               1,  & \\text{if $Y_{j}(S_{i}) \\geq q \\cdot Max(Y_{j})$} \\\\
               0, & \\text{if otherwise}
               \\end{cases}\\!$$


               
**MSY based Escapement Goal range**
$$\left \{ S_{MSY}\leftarrow \left [ S_{l}\: ,\:S_{u}  \right ]|P(S)\geq p \right \}$$

### Rmax Proile 
Rmax Profile calculates the probability of a given spawner size producing recruits that are above q% of Rmax.  **Note that Ricker SR model only.  Rmax does not exist in Beverton-Holt SR model.**  

The Rmax profile is calculated in following steps.  
* At each Bayesian samples SR parameters (j) and given spawner range(S)
  * Calculate expected recruit $R_{j}(S_{i})$ and find the maximum recruit (**Rmax**) $Max(R_{j})$
  * Assign $X_{i,j}$ to 1 if the expected recruit is above the minimum q% of the Rmax or 0 if otherwise
* At each escapement take the mean of X from all the simulation samples. 
* Rmax Profile Range $S_{max}$ is a range of spawners such that the profile probability is above the minimum p% target.  

This is written as: 
**Rmax based spawner profile**
$$P(S_{i}) =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{i,j}}{n}$$
where
$$X_{i,j}=\\begin{cases}
               1,  & \\text{if $R_{j}(S_{i}) \\geq q \\cdot Max(R_{j})$} \\\\
               0, & \\text{if otherwise}
               \\end{cases}\\!$$
**Smax Escapement Goal range**
$$\left \{ S_{max}\leftarrow \left [ S_{l}\: ,\:S_{u}  \right ]|P(S)\geq p \right \}$$
