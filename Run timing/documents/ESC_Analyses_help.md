## Escapement Only Analyses
A formal stock assessment analysis requires sapawner (escapement) and recruit data from which a production potential can be estimated.  However, in many cases only escapement data are available. Harvest data may not be collected.  In mixed stock fisheries harvest of a particular spawning tributary stock may not also be identifiable. In such cases, two alternative escapement goal setting methods are available: Percentile and Risk analysis methods.  
**Fundamental assumption of the both methods are that a stock, escapements, and its fishery have been stable for a long-term, or that the stock and fishery appear to have been sustainable.** 


### Percentile method:
Percentile analysis method is first developed by Bue and Hasbrouck (unpublished) (See [Bue et al. 2002](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/RIR.2A.2002.35.pdf)) that was further evaluated by [Clark et al. 2014](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMS14-06.pdf).  This analysis is aimed to develop an escapement goal for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the absence of stock production analysis.  
The Percentile method has 3 tiers with specific selection criteria:

* **Tier 1: Goal Range: 20th - 60th percentile** 
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Low to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 2: Goal Range: 15th - 65th percentile**
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * Low measurement error (weir or tower surveys)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 3 Goal Range: 5th - 65th percentile**
  * Low escapement contrast (< 8)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Use of the Percentile approach is NOT recommended**
  * Very low escapement contrast (< 4)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Moderate to high assumed average harvest rate (> 40%)  


### Risk analysis method: 
Risk analysis method method is developed by [Bernad et al. 2009](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/SP09-09.pdf). This analysis is aimed to develop an escapement goal for a non-targeted salmon stock  that harvest is **incidental of bycatch** of other fisheries.  In this case, management objective of the stock is setting a precautionally reference points (PRPs): a spawning abundance that is low enough to warrant reducing its exploitation rate, but not so low as to engender its stock collapse.
